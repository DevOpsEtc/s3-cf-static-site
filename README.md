### S3 Static Site Deployment Using Python, CloudFormation and AWS CI/CD Services

This project takes a static site generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), throws it into an AWS S3 bucket, serves it via the AWS CloudFront CDN, and automatically updates the site when new posts get committed to its code repo. Most of this gets done with the help of AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) and AWS CloudFormation, which provisions and configures the initial infrastructure and ongoing CI/CD pipeline. The rest is handled by your local development environment, which gets bootstrapped with a git repo, sample site, git remote into the AWS cloud, and management tools to help with tasks. Going forward, you simply compose new posts in markdown, git commit and git push.
