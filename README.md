### Deploy a Static Site Served by CDN and Updated Via CI/CD... all with AWS

This project takes a static site generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), throws it into an AWS S3 bucket, serves it via the AWS CloudFront CDN, and automatically updates the production site when new content is committed to the code repository. Heavy lifting by AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) and AWS CloudFormation, which provisions and configures the initial infrastructure and ongoing CI/CD pipeline. The rest is handled by your local development environment, which gets bootstrapped with a local and remote repo, sample site and management tools to help automate tasks. Going forward, you simply compose new posts in markdown, git commit and git push.
